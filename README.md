# Docker_Kubernetes
This IT project involves setting up Docker and Kubernetes on two different environments: a Windows 10 machine (Client1) and an Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS virtual machine. The goal is to create an isolated development environment using containers and Kubernetes to streamline the development and testing processes.
